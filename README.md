# Hi, I'm Atul 👋

I'm a Machine Learning engineer and researcher based in Marburg, Germany, working at the intersection of **speech/audio**, **computer vision**, and **scalable backend systems**. I enjoy taking ideas from prototype to production – from deep learning models all the way to containers and monitoring.

---

## 🔭 What I'm working on

- Research on **3D medical imaging** (dental scans) – segmentation + diagnostic models  
- **Historical speech analysis** using adapted Transformer architectures and audio features  
- Building and tuning **speech alignment** and subtitle pipelines using Whisper-like models, torchaudio, and FFmpeg  
- Teaching & mentoring students in core **Machine Learning** concepts

## 💼 Experience

- **Research Assistant – Machine Learning**, Philipps-Universität Marburg  
- **Teaching Assistant – Machine Learning**, Philipps-Universität Marburg  
- **Senior Software Engineer**, Comviva (SMS platforms, high-availability systems, observability, containers)  
- **Software Engineer**, Comviva (telecom, messaging platforms, emergency communication flows)
---

## 🧠 Interests

- Speech & audio ML (**forced alignment, transcription, annotation tools**)  
- Representation learning on sequential data (audio, time series)  
- ML systems: **data pipelines, training infrastructure, deployment, monitoring**  
- Distributed systems & DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, metrics & logging  

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Languages**  
- Python, C/C++, Java, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Bash  

**ML / Data**  
- PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn  
- Hugging Face Transformers, Librosa, Pandas, NumPy  

**Backend & Infra**  
- FastAPI, REST APIs  
- Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Ansible  
- Prometheus, Grafana, Kafka, Spark  

**Databases / Storage**  
- MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, OracleDB  
- Redis, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch

## 📌 Selected Projects

- **Historical Speech Annotator**  
  Adapted a Transformer-based architecture to analyze and annotate historical speeches from audio (Mel-spectrograms), extracting themes, emotional tone, and rhetorical patterns. Includes interactive visualisations and semi-automatic annotation tools for researchers.

- **Sahyog – Leftover Food Redistribution App (Android)**  
  Android app that uses geolocation and notifications to connect event organizers with nearby people in need and redistribute surplus food. Built with Mapbox, Firebase, Java, and Android Studio.

- **High-availability SMS Platform (Telco)**  
  - Designed backup and failover mechanisms using Redis/KeyDB to improve recovery in crash scenarios.  
  - Containerised and scaled out the SMS gateway using Docker + Kubernetes + Helm.  
  - Integrated real-time KPI metrics for dashboards (SigNoz/Grafana).
