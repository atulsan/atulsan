## About

I work on machine learning for speech, audio, and imaging, and I have a strong background in backend systems for high-availability telecom applications. I like building end-to-end solutions, from data and modeling to deployment and monitoring.

## Current Role

**Research Assistant, Machine Learning – Philipps-Universität Marburg**  
Mar 2025 – Present  

- Designing deep learning pipelines for 3D dental scan analysis, including segmentation and diagnostic models.  
- Working on image processing and machine learning models to identify and count insect species from lab trap photos.  
- Contributing to a full-stack web application for speech analysis, extracting and interpreting information from speech data.  
- Implementing and improving forced alignment pipelines using Whisper-like models, torchaudio, and FFmpeg to produce accurate time-coded subtitles.

## Previous Experience

**Teaching Assistant, Machine Learning – Philipps-Universität Marburg**  
Oct 2024 – Mar 2025  

- Supported students with core machine learning concepts through office hours, recitations, and 1:1 sessions.  
- Designed and developed datasets for two student hackathons (car price prediction and image detection) hosted on Kaggle.  

**Senior Software Engineer – Comviva, Bengaluru**  
Dec 2022 – Mar 2024  

- Designed backup and failover mechanisms for SMSGateway using Redis/KeyDB to improve recovery in crash scenarios.  
- Introduced real-time KPI metrics for monitoring and dashboards (for example, SigNoz and Grafana).  
- Built APIs for Etisalat UAE’s Ngage integration with SMSGateway to manage SMSCs dynamically.  
- Scaled SMSGateway using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm to support growing traffic and better resource management.

**Software Engineer – Comviva, Bengaluru**  
Jul 2021 – Nov 2022  

- Engineered and deployed an SOS failure SMS push mechanism for Volvo vehicles to support emergency communication.  
- Added multi-language integration so the application could communicate seamlessly with different network providers via SMSGateway without data loss.

## Projects

**Historical Speech Annotator Using an Adapted Transformer Model**  

- Adapted a Transformer-based architecture to analyze and annotate historical speeches using Mel-spectrograms as input.  
- Extracted thematic elements, emotional tone, and rhetorical patterns and built interactive visualizations and semi-automatic annotation tools for researchers.  
- Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Pandas, NumPy, Librosa.  

**Dictator Speeches Edition Web-App** 

- Developing a full-stack web application for a speech analysis system that extracts and interprets information from speech data using semantic analysis using Python and JavaScript.
- Provides brief summary of each speeches, transcript, subtitles and semantic analysis.
- Additionally, forced alignment was implemented using a heavily modified WhisperX pipeline mainly using torchaudio and FFmpeg to produce time-coded subtitles from the supplied transcripts overtaking in accuracy of the current Nvidia’s NeMo FA pipeline.

**Dental Ai** 

- Designing a deep learning pipeline for 3D dental scan analysis, including segmentation of teeth and surrounding structures.
- Built a diagnostic model to detect dental issues and assess the necessity of surgical intervention.

**Sahyog App** 

- Build an android application to minimize the wastage of the food by providing it to the people in need.
- The idea is to use their geolocation because nowadays everybody has a smartphone. We can notify them or can directly reach out to them.
